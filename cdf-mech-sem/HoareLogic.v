(** * 4.  Program logics: Hoare logic *)

(** ** 4.1.  Prelude: direct verification of a program *)

(** We can verify the correctness of a program using nothing but an
    operational semantics for the language in which it is written.
    For example, here is an IMP program that exchanges the values of
    two variables. *) 

Definition swap_xy :=
    ASSIGN "t" (VAR "x");; ASSIGN "x" (VAR "y");; ASSIGN "y" (VAR "t").

(** We can characterize the expected behavior of the program as
    follows: started in a store [s], the program always terminates, in
    a store [s'] where ["x"] has value [s "y"] and ["y"] has value [s "x"]. *)

Lemma swap_xy_correct:
  forall s, exists s',
  star red (swap_xy, s) (SKIP, s') /\ s' "x" = s "y" /\ s' "y" = s "x".
Proof.
  intros. econstructor; split.
- eapply star_step. apply red_seq_step. apply red_assign.
  eapply star_step. apply red_seq_done.
  eapply star_step. apply red_seq_step. apply red_assign.
  eapply star_step. apply red_seq_done.
  eapply star_step. apply red_assign.
  apply star_refl.
- unfold update; cbn. auto.
Qed.

(** The proof script is long but not difficult.  First, we perform a
    "symbolic execution" of the program by chaining reduction steps.
    This determines the final store [s'], which is easily shown
    to satisfy the expected property. *)

(** Here is a more complicated example, involving a loop.
    The program adds ["x"] to ["y"] by incrementing ["y"] and
    decrementing ["x"] until ["x"] drops to zero. *)

Definition slow_add :=
  WHILE (LESSEQUAL (CONST 1) (VAR "x"))
        (ASSIGN "x" (MINUS (VAR "x") (CONST 1)) ;;
         ASSIGN "y" (PLUS  (VAR "y") (CONST 1))).

(** The statement of correctness for this program remains simple. *)

Lemma slow_add_correct:
  forall s,
  s "x" >= 0 ->
  exists s', star red (slow_add, s) (SKIP, s') /\ s' "y" = s "y" + s "x".
Proof.
  assert (REC: forall v, 0 <= v -> 
               forall s, s "x" = v ->
               exists s', star red (slow_add, s) (SKIP, s') /\ s' "y" = s "y" + s "x").

    + apply star_one. apply red_while_done. cbn. rewrite H. apply Z.leb_nle. lia.
    + lia.
  - intros v VPOS REC s EQ.
    set (s1 := update "x" v s).
    set (s2 := update "y" (s "y" + 1) s1).
    destruct (REC s2) as (s' & REDS & EQ'). auto.
    exists s'; split.
    + eapply star_step. apply red_while_loop. cbn. rewrite EQ. apply Z.leb_le. lia.
      eapply star_step. apply red_seq_step. apply red_seq_step. apply red_assign.
      eapply star_step. apply red_seq_step. apply red_seq_done.
      eapply star_step. apply red_seq_step. apply red_assign.
      eapply star_step. apply red_seq_done.
      cbn. replace (s "x" - 1) with v by lia. apply REDS.
    + rewrite EQ'. cbn. lia.
  }
  intros. eapply REC; eauto. lia.
Qed.

(** The proof, however, is rather difficult.  We need to perform
    an explicit induction on the value [v] of variable ["x"].
    To use the induction hypothesis, we must manually determine
    some of the intermediate stores: purely symbolic execution
    no longer suffices.  It is inconceivable to verify much more
    complex programs with these techniques! *)

(** Program logics provide higher-level reasoning principles to formally
    verify programs.  In particular, they provide ways to reason about
    loops without setting up a full proof by induction. *)

(** The most familiar program logic is Hoare logic.  In this module,
    we build a Hoare logic to reason about programs written in IMP. *)

(** ** 4.2.  Assertions on the values of variables *)

(** Hoare logic manipulates formulas / claims / assertions that "talk about"
    the values of the program variables.  A typical assertion is
    [0 <= x /\ x <= y], meaning "at this program point, the value of 
    variable [x] is positive and less than or equal to the value of
    variable [y]". *)

(** In our Coq development, we represent assertions by Coq logical formulas
    (type [Prop]) parameterized by the current store, which provides
    the values of the variables.
  
      For example, the assertion [0 <= x /\ x <= y] above is represented
    by the Coq predicate [fun s => 0 <= s "x" /\ s "x" <= s "y"]. *)
    
Definition assertion : Type := store -> Prop.

(** Here are some useful assertions.
    Conjunction and disjunction of two assertions. *)

Definition aand (P Q: assertion) : assertion :=
  fun s => P s /\ Q s.

Definition aor (P Q: assertion) : assertion :=
  fun s => P s \/ Q s.

(** The assertion "arithmetic expression [a] evaluates to value [v]". *)

Definition aequal (a: aexp) (v: Z) : assertion :=
  fun s => aeval a s = v.

(** The assertions "Boolean expression [b] evaluates to true / to false". *)

Definition atrue (b: bexp) : assertion :=
  fun s => beval b s = true.

Definition afalse (b: bexp) : assertion :=
  fun s => beval b s = false.

(** The assertion written "[ P[x <- a] ]" in the literature.
    Substituting [a] for [x] in [P] amounts to evaluating [P] in
    stores where the variable [x] is equal to the value of expression [a]. *)

Definition aupdate (x: ident) (a: aexp) (P: assertion) : assertion :=
  fun s => P (update x (aeval a s) s).

(** Pointwise implication.  Unlike conjunction and disjunction, this is
    not a predicate over the store, just a Coq proposition. *)

Definition aimp (P Q: assertion) : Prop :=
  forall s, P s -> Q s.

(** A few notations to improve legibility. *)

Notation "P -->> Q" := (aimp P Q) (at level 95, no associativity).
Notation "P //\\ Q" := (aand P Q) (at level 80, right associativity).
Notation "P \\// Q" := (aor P Q) (at level 75, right associativity).

(** ** 4.3.  The rules of weak Hoare logic *)

(** Here are the base rules for Hoare logic.
    They define a relation [Hoare P c Q], where
-   [P] is the precondition, assumed to hold "before" executing [c];
-   [c] is the program or program fragment we reason about;
-   [Q] is the postcondition, guaranteed to hold "after" executing [c].

  This is a "weak" logic, meaning that it does not guarantee termination
  of the command [c].  What is guaranteed is that if [c] terminates,
  then its final store satisfies postcondition [Q]. *)

    without using a third, temporary variable. *)

  ASSIGN "x" (PLUS (VAR "x") (VAR "y")) ;;
  ASSIGN "y" (MINUS (VAR "x") (VAR "y")) ;;
  ASSIGN "x" (MINUS (VAR "x") (VAR "y")).

(** Prove that this program satisfies the same property as [swap_xy].
    Hint: rework the proof script for [Hoare_swap_xy], only minimal
    changes need to be made. *)

Example Hoare_swap_xy_2: forall m n,
  Hoare (aequal (VAR "x") m //\\ aequal (VAR "y") n)
        swap_xy_2
        (aequal (VAR "x") n //\\ aequal (VAR "y") m).

(** ** 4.4.  Soundness of Hoare logic *)

(** We give a semantic interpretation to the statements [Hoare P c Q]
    of Hoare logic.  The interpretation is the relation [triple P c Q]
    defined below in terms of IMP's natural semantics
    (the relation [cexec s c s']). *)

Definition triple (P: assertion) (c: com) (Q: assertion) : Prop :=
  forall s s', cexec s c s' -> P s -> Q s'.

Notation "{{ P }} c {{ Q }}" := (triple P c Q) (at level 90, c at next level).

(** It follows that Hoare logic is sound: every triple derivable by the

(** ** 4.5.  Completeness of Hoare logic *)

(** The converse of theorem [Hoare_sound] is true: a "Hoare triple"
    that holds semantically ([{{P}} c {{Q}}]) can always be derived
    using the rules of the logic ([Hoare P c Q]).  The proof relies
    on the notion of "weakest precondition" (WP). *)

(** The weakest precondition for a command [c] with postcondition [Q]. *)

Definition wp (c: com) (Q: assertion) : assertion :=

(** ** 4.6.  Other useful rules *)

(** Using the semantic definition of Hoare triples, it is easy to add
    new reasoning rules: these are just lemmas about the operational
    semantics that we prove once and for all.  For example: *)

Lemma triple_conj:
  forall c P1 Q1 P2 Q2,
  {{P1}} c {{Q1}} -> {{P2}} c {{Q2}} -> {{P1 //\\ P2}} c {{Q1 //\\ Q2}}.
Proof.

Proof.
  intros; red; intros. destruct H2 as [PRE1|PRE2]; [left|right]; eauto.
Qed.

(** We can also give an alternate rule to reason about assignments.
    The alternate rule is a "forward" rule (the postcondition is
    determined by the precondition), unlike Hoare's rule which is "backward". *)

Definition aexists {A: Type} (P: A -> assertion) : assertion :=
  fun (s: store) => exists (a: A), P a s.

Lemma triple_assign_fwd: forall x a P,
  {{ P }}
  ASSIGN x a 
  {{ aexists (fun m => aexists (fun n =>
     aequal (VAR x) n //\\ aupdate x (CONST m) (P //\\ aequal a n))) }}.
Proof.
  intros. unfold triple, aequal, aupdate; intros.
  inversion H; subst.
  exists (s x); exists (aeval a s); cbn.
  split. apply update_same.
  replace (update x (s x) (update x (aeval a s) s)) with s.
  split; auto.
  apply functional_extensionality; intros y.
  unfold update. destruct (string_dec x y); congruence.
Qed.

(** Finally, we build a frame rule that makes it possible to reuse
    an existing verification of [{{P} c {{Q}}]
    and add extra facts [R] to the precondition and the postcondition,
    obtaining a verification of [{{P //\\ R}} c {{Q //\\ R}}]. *)

(** For example: if we showed the correctness of [swap_xy] like this
<<
    {{ aequal (VAR "x") m //\\ aequal (VAR "y") n }}
    swap_xy
    {{ aequal (VAR "x") n //\\ aequal (VAR "y") m }}
>>
    we should be able, without having to re-do the verification de [swap_xy],
    to prove a more informative triple such as
<<
    {{ aequal (VAR "x") m //\\ aequal (VAR "y") n //\\ aequal (VAR "z") p }}
    swap_xy
    {{ aequal (VAR "x") n //\\ aequal (VAR "y") m //\\ aequal (VAR "z") p }}
>>
    to be read as: "furthermore, the value of variable [z] is unchanged". *)

(** This reasoning is valid provided the extra facts [R] mention exclusively
    variables that are not modified during the execution of [c].
    We approximate this requirement by saying that variables that occur
    as left-hand sides of an assignment in [c] can be modified,
    and other variables definitely cannot. *)

Fixpoint modified_by (c: com) (x: ident) : Prop :=
  match c with
  | SKIP => False
  | ASSIGN y a => x = y
  | SEQ c1 c2 => modified_by c1 x \/ modified_by c2 x
  | IFTHENELSE b c1 c2 => modified_by c1 x \/ modified_by c2 x
  | WHILE b c1 => modified_by c1 x
  end.

(** Syntactically, an assertion [P] is independent from a set [vars] of
    variables if none of the variables in [vars] is mentioned in [P].
    With out encoding of assertions as predicates [store -> Prop],
    we cannot state the independence condition like this, since
    the predicates are opaque functions.
    Instead, we will say that the assertion has the same truth value
    in any two stores [s1] and [s2] that differ only on the values of
    the variables in set [vars]. *)

Definition independent_of (P: assertion) (vars: ident -> Prop) : Prop :=
  forall s1 s2,
  (forall x, ~ vars x -> s1 x = s2 x) ->

(** ** 4.7.  Strong Hoare triples *)

(** The Hoare logic presented above is "weak" because it does not

(** Following similar approaches, we now construct a "strong" Hoare logic
    that guarantees termination and therefore proves total correctness
    results. *)

(** As we did for the weak logic, we could give the rules of the strong

(** The "variant" trick and the order on nonnegative integers are sometimes
    insufficient to show termination of a [WHILE] loop.
    Here is a more powerful rule that uses two variant expressions
    and a lexicographic ordering between pairs of nonnegative integers.
    Show that this rule is sound. *)

(** ** 4.8.  Verification condition generation *)

(** With the exception of the rule for [WHILE] loops, the rules of
    Hoare logic can be read as an algorithm that, given a command [c]
    and a postcondition [Q], computes the weakest precondition [P].
    For example, if [c] comprises two assignments in sequence
<<
    c = ASSIGN x1 a1 ;; ASSIGN x2 a2
>>
    the precondition [P] is determined as
<<
    P = aupdate x1 a1 (aupdate x2 a2 Q)
>>
    Such a computation is much simpler than general proof search,
    which can apply the weakening rule [triple_consequence] at any point. *)

(** Of course, the problem is with [WHILE] loops: the loop invariant
    cannot be determined automatically by a computation. *)

(** In the following, we develop a hybrid approach where loops are
    manually annotated with their loop invariants, but all other preconditions
    are automatically computed from the postconditions. *)

Module VCGEN.

(** This is the language of commands where [WHILE] loops are annotated by
    an invariant [Inv]. *)

Inductive com: Type :=
  | SKIP
  | ASSIGN (x: ident) (a: aexp)
  | SEQ (c1: com) (c2: com)
  | IFTHENELSE (b: bexp) (c1: com) (c2: com)
  | WHILE (Inv: assertion) (b: bexp) (c1: com).  (**r new! *)

(** The function [pre c Q] computes a precondition for command [c]
    and postcondition [Q], by "backward execution" of command [c] and
    application of the rules of Hoare logic.  The only exception is
    [WHILE] loops, where we take as precondition the loop invariant
    provided. *)

Fixpoint pre (c: com) (Q: assertion) : assertion :=
  match c with
  | SKIP => Q
  | ASSIGN x a => aupdate x a Q
  | SEQ c1 c2 => pre c1 (pre c2 Q)
  | IFTHENELSE b c1 c2 => atrue b //\\ pre c1 Q \\// afalse b //\\ pre c2 Q
  | WHILE Inv b c => Inv
  end.

(** The Hoare triple [ {{ pre c Q }} c {{ Q }} ] is not always valid:
    we must also ensure that the invariants provided for the loops are
    actually invariant.  For a loop [WHILE Inv b c] having postcondition [Q],
    it must be the case that
-   [afalse b //\\ Inv -->> Q] : 
    when the loop stops, the invariant implies the postcondition;
-   [atrue b //\\ Inv -->> pre c Inv] :
    when the loop iterates, the invariant implies the precondition of
    the loop body.

    The following function [vcg] (Verification Condition Generator) 
    collects all these "verification conditions" for all the loops [WHILE]
    contained in command [c]. *)

Fixpoint vcg (c: com) (Q: assertion) : Prop :=
  match c with
  | SKIP => True
  | ASSIGN x a => True
  | SEQ c1 c2 => vcg c1 (pre c2 Q) /\ vcg c2 Q
  | IFTHENELSE b c1 c2 => vcg c1 Q /\ vcg c2 Q
  | WHILE Inv b c =>
       vcg c Inv
    /\ (afalse b //\\ Inv -->> Q)
    /\ (atrue b //\\ Inv -->> pre c Inv)
  end.

(** The triple [ {{P}} c {{Q}} ] is valid as soon as
-   [P] implies the precondition [pre c Q]
-   the conditions [vcg c Q] are true.
*)

Definition vcgen (P: assertion) (c: com) (Q: assertion) : Prop :=
  (P -->> pre c Q) /\ vcg c Q.

(** To prove this verification algorithm correct, we define
    the plain IMP command [erase c] obtained from the annotated command [c]
z    by erasing the loop invariants from the [WHILE] nodes. *)

Fixpoint erase (c: com) : IMP.com :=
  match c with
  | SKIP => IMP.SKIP
  | ASSIGN x a => IMP.ASSIGN x a
  | SEQ c1 c2 => IMP.SEQ (erase c1) (erase c2)
  | IFTHENELSE b c1 c2 => IMP.IFTHENELSE b (erase c1) (erase c2)
  | WHILE Inv b c => IMP.WHILE b (erase c)
  end.

(** We can then show that [pre c Q] is a valid precondition for [c] and [Q],
    provided that the conditions [vcg c Q] are true. *)

(** *** Application: Euclidean division *)

(** And here is its correctness proof.  It does not use explicitly any
    rules of Hoare logic.  Instead, we apply the [vcgen_correct]
    theorem, then ask Coq to compute and simplify the verification
    condition.  In the end, all what remains is a formula in standard
